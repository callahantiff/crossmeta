Title: Cross Platform Meta-Analysis of Microarrays
Version: 0.99.5
Author: Alex Pickering
Maintainer: Alex Pickering <alexvpickering@gmail.com>
Description: Implements cross platform and species meta-analyses of Affymentrix,
    Illumina, and Agilent microarray data. This package automates common tasks
    such as downloading, normalizing, and annotating raw GEO data. A user
    interface makes it easy to select control and treatment samples for each
    contrast and study. This input is used for subsequent surrogate variable
    analysis (models unaccounted sources of variation) and differential
    expression analysis. Effect sizes from differential expression analyses
    can be combined. This meta-analysis can asses genes measured in only a subset
    of studies.
