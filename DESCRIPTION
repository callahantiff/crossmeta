Title: Cross Platform Meta-Analysis of Microarrays
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Alex", "Pickering", email = "alexvpickering@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements cross platform meta-analysis of Affymentrix, Illumina,
    and Agilent microarray data. This package automates common tasks such
    downloading, normalizing, and annotating raw GEO data. A user interface makes it
    easy to select control and treatment samples for each contrast and study. This
    input is used for subsequent surrogate variable analysis (models unaccounted
    sources of variation) and differential expression analysis. The results of
    differential expression analysis are used by the MAMA package to perform various
    meta analysis methods.
